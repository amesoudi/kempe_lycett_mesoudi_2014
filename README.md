# Code for Kempe, Lycett & Mesoudi (2014)

This repository contains R code for running the models and reproducing the figures reported in:
Kempe, M., Lycett, S.J. & Mesoudi, A. (2014) From cultural traditions to cumulative culture: parameterizing the differences between human and nonhuman culture. *Journal of Theoretical Biology 359*, 29-36.
Available at https://www.alexmesoudi.com/publication/kempe-cultural-2014/Kempe_Lycett_Mesoudi_JTB_2014.pdf

Note that the original was coded by MK. The code in this repository is a recreation by AM. It currently contains Model 1 (cultural traditions) and Model 2 (cumulative culture), and code to recreate Figures 1-5. Model 3 (combined) and Figures 6 and 7 will be added soon.

Also included are the figures generated with this code. There are minor formatting differences to the published versions (e.g. the color scheme used), but the results shown are the same.
